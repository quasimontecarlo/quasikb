another split 36key keyboard


I am a huge fan of pashutk's chocofi as it's the first split ergo keyboard I've got to use and fall in love with. After a year of use I found myself wanting to tweak some of its design to better fit my hands. Although I love its compact design I felt the need to spread out the keys a little and give an heavier pinky stagger and ring and pinky slant. The thumb cluster is also spaced out more to help with a more comfortable reach. The keys are a little spaced between each other as to have a more comfortable spacing between fingers. To achieve all of this I've used ergogen and designed my keyboard from scratch, that said a huge portion of its look and inspiration goes to the chocofi as I still use it daily and wanted my custom keyboard to be ready to use, and not have to adapt once more to a new keyboard layout. For this reason I've opted for this not to be a direct fork, but rather used pashutk's work as an inspiration to create quasikb.

Aesthetics and ergonomy aside, for per the hardware I also decided to go a slightly different route, I daily drive a fully bluetooth chocofi, equipped with nice nanos and nice views. For my keyboard I preferred not to have nice views, as albeit useful at times, I didn't felt the absolute need for them especially considering the added cost. Gone also are the diodes, I definitely didn't want to hand solder those, and opted for an easier solder job with just direct to GPIOs connections. Since I've designed this for myself I didn't opt to add anything more than the absolute needful, this means that this keyborad design, as it currently stands, doesn't support TRSS jacks and wired builds, doesn't support nice views, LEDs and it's intended to be used with nice nanos and fully bluetooth with zmk.
